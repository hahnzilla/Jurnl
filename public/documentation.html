 	<h2> <a id="intro">Introduction</a>  </h2> 
 		<p> &nbsp; Donut is a one-stop shop for writers of all skill levels to improve and track their writing habits over time. With configurable word count and words/minute goals, hash tagging and intuitive search tools, Donut has everything you'll need to effectively chart and improve your journaling skills in a clear, consolidated approach. </p>
 		<p> &nbsp; Donut works by providing its users with a private online repository of journal entries. As users populate their repositories, the system logs information about the users' habits on each entry including details like number of distractions, number of spelling errors and average words per minute. The Donut editor may be configured to display this information in real time, providing immediate feedback to writers more aggressively tracking their skills. </p>
 		<p> &nbsp; In addition to these performance tracking features, Donut is also a convenient cloud-based journaling solution for the casual writer. The editor supports all common phrase-level and block-level formatting that a journaler might need including lists, blockquotes, monospaced and verbatim; color, size and emphasized text. With Donut, your work is available anywhere, anytime, exportable in text and HTML formats. </p>
 		<p> &nbsp; Whether you are actively pursuing improved writing skills, curious about your abilities, or just want a convenient, available-everywhere writing collection, take a bite out of Donut, and experience the sweet solution.  </p>

 	<h2> <a id="creating">Creating and Editing an Entry</a> </h2>
 		<p> &nbsp; To get started, click on the new entry button on your homepage. This will open a text editor that allows you to create and edit an entry. </p>
 		<h3> &nbsp; The following editing features are available to use: </h3>
 		<ul>
 			<li> Font Tools </li>
 			<li> Layout Tools </li>
 			<li> Formatting Tools </li>

 	<h2> <a id="tagging">Tagging Entries</a> </h2>
 	<p> Tag any word within an entry by putting a # infront of the word that you wish to tag. Hashtagging a word within a post will make that word searchable. </p> 

 	<h2> <a id="searching">Searching Entries</a> </h2>
 	<p> You can search your entries for the following: 
 		<ul>
 			<li> Hash-tagged words </li>
 			<li> Content of an entry </li>
 			<li> Date an entry was posted </li>
 		</ul>
 	<p> Go ahead and give it a try! See what you were thinking about last week, last month, or even last year! If you have entries that are a year old then you must be some sort of time traveler! If that's the case then David forgot to import the gem required to detect time travelers. Damnit David. </p>
 	<h2> <a id="preferences">Managing your Preferences</a> </h2>
 		<p> &nbsp; Open the preferences page and save defaults! You can change the background color and font color of the editor.  </p>

 		<h3> &nbsp; Word Count </h3>
 		<p> &nbsp; Word Count lists the minimum, maximum, and average word counts for your overall posts. </p>
 		<h3> &nbsp; Distraction Count </h3>
 		<p> &nbsp; Distractions are counted for every second there is not a keystroke detected after 10 seconds. To decrease your distractions while typing, close out of all programs that you would be likely to switch to during your journal entry. It might also be helpful to brainstorm before beginning your entry so you don't run out of ideas to type about. Distraction Count lists the minimum, maximum, and average time distracted for all posts. </p>
 		<h3> &nbsp; Duration </h3>
 		<p> &nbsp; Duration will list the minimum, maximum, and average duration time of your overall posts. </p>
 		<h3> &nbsp; Words Per Minute </h3>

 	<h2> <a id="export">Export Data</a> </h2>
