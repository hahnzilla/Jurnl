 	<h2> <a id="intro">Introduction</a>  </h2> 
 		<p> &nbsp; Donut is a one-stop shop for writers of all skill levels to improve and track their writing habits over time. With configurable word count and words/minute goals, hash tagging and intuitive search tools, Donut has everything you'll need to effectively chart and improve your journaling skills in a clear, consolidated approach. </p>
 		<p> &nbsp; Donut works by providing its users with a private online repository of journal entries. As users populate their repositories, the system logs information about the users' habits on each entry including details like number of distractions, number of spelling errors and average words per minute. The Donut editor may be configured to display this information in real time, providing immediate feedback to writers more aggressively tracking their skills. </p>
 		<p> &nbsp; In addition to these performance tracking features, Donut is also a convenient cloud-based journaling solution for the casual writer. The editor supports all common phrase-level and block-level formatting that a journaler might need including lists, blockquotes, monospaced and verbatim; color, size and emphasized text. With Donut, your work is available anywhere, anytime, exportable in text and HTML formats. </p>
 		<p> &nbsp; Whether you are actively pursuing improved writing skills, curious about your abilities, or just want a convenient, available-everywhere writing collection, take a bite out of Donut, and experience the sweet solution.  </p>
